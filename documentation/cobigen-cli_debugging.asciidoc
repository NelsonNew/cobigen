= Debugging Cobigen-CLI:

Open Debug Configurations by clicking on the "Debug Configurations" icon in Eclipse.
Click on "Java Application" and then click on "New".
Select the "cli" project and set the Main class to "com.devonfw.cobigen.cli.CobiGenCLI".
Add any arguments that you would normally use when running the CLI.
Make sure that every CLI command is possible. For example, you can use the command "g 'PATH TO EmployeeEntity.java'".
Under the File System tab, set the Working Directory to the directory where the CLI is opened.
Open cobigen.bat and add the following flag to the command:

Put the marked section of the code above (before cp) into the Arguments field.
Go to the Remote Java Application tab in Debug Configurations and click on "New".
Select the "cli" project and set the Connection Type to "Standard (Socket Attach)".
Set the Host to "localhost" and the Port to the value shown in the screenshot.
Save the configuration and start the debugger.
To debug system tests for the CLI, open the file "cg.bat" located in "Cli > src > main > assembly > resources".
Add the marked command from the screenshot to the file before "-cp".
Repeat step 14, but add the command before "cp".
Rebuild the CLI by running "mvn clean install -f cobigen-cli/ -DskipTests" so that the files are included in the jar.
